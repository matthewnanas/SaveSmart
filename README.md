# SaveSmart
Let's tackle rising grocery prices -- together.

SaveSmart is website that allows users to determine which grocery store in the DMV has the lowest total price for their shopping list. The front end focuses on what the user will see while the backend works to fetch store prices based on user input. Prices are found using instacart data and sent back to the our server and stored, where there after the information will be displayed on the site for users to see.
